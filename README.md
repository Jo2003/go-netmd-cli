# go-netmd cli

This is a simple command-line implementation of the [go-netmd-lib](https://github.com/enimatek-nl/go-netmd-lib)

This is still a **WIP**.

# usage

`netmd-cli help`

# download

Choose the platform below for which you would like to download the cli and put all files in the same directory.

In case **usblib-1.0** is already installed on the system you will probably not need the extra download.
